# SISR_Deeplearning
This is our repo for our Deep Learning Class

The code you see in the zip file is the model we used. There source for the original github is https://github.com/xinntao/ESRGAN

The code in the SISR_Deep_learning notebook is how we cropped our images using cv2. We used the resource https://oleksandrg.medium.com/how-to-divide-the-image-into-4-parts-using-opencv-c0afb5cab10c
in order to figure out how to do this
